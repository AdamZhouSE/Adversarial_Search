# Pacman_GamePlay
In this project, we apply different movement methods to the pacman
and ghosts in the game. The detailed description of the project is in the CIML_assignment_2.pdf file.

There are 6 problems.
1. A random pacman against a random ghost
2. A smart pacman against a random ghost
3. A random pacman against up to 4 ghosts
4. A smart pacman against up to 4 ghosts
5. Minimax pacman game
6. Expectimax pacman game


We implement Game class and Board class to simulate the game, which will reduce redundancy in the code. 
You can check the code and comments in p1-p6.py files to understand the implementation of the problems.
